## üèóÔ∏è **Development Process & Architecture**

### **Phase 1: Initial Codebase Analysis**
- **Challenge**: Inherited incomplete codebase with critical bugs
- **Issues Found**: 
  - Missing GraphQL schema files (MyAppSchema, BaseMutation)
  - Missing type definitions (UserType, MatchType, MessageType, etc.)
  - Incorrect field references in mutations
  - Non-functional authentication system
- **Resolution**: Systematic code review and architectural rebuilding

### **Phase 2: GraphQL API Design**
- **Schema Architecture**: 
  - Created comprehensive type system for Users, Matches, Messages, Conversations, Photos
  - Implemented 15+ mutations for complete CRUD operations
  - Built 8+ query resolvers for data retrieval
  - Added proper field definitions with null handling and type safety

- **Authentication Integration**:
  - JWT token generation and validation
  - Context-based user authentication in GraphQL
  - Protected mutations with `require_current_user!` helper
  - Admin-only operations with `require_admin!` authorization

### **Phase 3: Business Logic Implementation**
- **Matching System**:
  - Mutual like detection algorithm
  - Match creation with proper user ordering (user_one_id < user_two_id)
  - Like/dislike state management with database callbacks
  - Unmatch functionality with proper cleanup

- **Messaging System**:
  - Match-based conversation creation
  - Message threading with chronological ordering
  - Read/unread status tracking
  - Conversation management between matched users

- **User Management**:
  - Profile creation with comprehensive validation
  - Age calculation from birthdate
  - Gender preference filtering for potential matches
  - Photo management with primary photo selection

### **Phase 4: Database Design & Relationships**
- **Tables Created**:
  - Users: Complete profile information with authentication
  - Likes: Swipe history with like/dislike boolean
  - Matches: Mutual like relationships with unique constraints
  - Conversations: Chat sessions between matched users
  - Messages: Individual chat messages with metadata
  - Photos: User photo uploads with ordering and primary selection

- **Relationships Established**:
  - Complex user associations (matches_as_user_one, matches_as_user_two)
  - Conversation bidirectional user relationships
  - Photo ordering and primary photo logic
  - Foreign key constraints for data integrity

## üîß **Critical Issues Identified & Resolved**

### **Issue 1: Authentication System Failures**
- **Problem**: Multiple mutations returning "Authentication required" instead of proper errors
- **Root Cause**: GraphiQL Authorization headers not properly configured during testing
- **Resolution**: Established proper JWT token setup and header configuration
- **Impact**: Enabled proper testing of all authenticated endpoints

### **Issue 2: Empty Query Results**
- **Problem**: Matches query returning empty arrays despite existing matches
- **Root Cause**: GraphQL field naming convention mismatches (camelCase vs snake_case)
- **Resolution**: Standardized field naming and parameter handling
- **Impact**: Restored full query functionality across all resolvers

### **Issue 3: GraphQL Schema Inconsistencies**  
- **Problem**: Field name mismatches causing parameter handling failures
- **Specific Issues**: `currentUser`, `userId`, `conversationId` naming conflicts
- **Resolution**: Aligned GraphQL schema with Ruby naming conventions
- **Impact**: Achieved consistent API behavior across all queries and mutations

### **Issue 4: Error Response Standardization**
- **Problem**: Inconsistent error responses for different failure scenarios
- **Resolution**: Implemented standardized error handling with proper GraphQL error formatting
- **Impact**: Professional-grade error responses for all edge cases
