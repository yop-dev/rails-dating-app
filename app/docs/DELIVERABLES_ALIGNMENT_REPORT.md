## ⚠️ Partially Aligned Features

### 1. Profile Page
**Status: ⚠️ 85% Complete - Limited Editing Scope**

**✅ Fully Supported:**
- First Name, Last Name editing
- Bio and School editing  
- Gender Interest editing
- Complete photo management (upload, delete, set primary, 5-photo limit)

**❌ Limitations:**
The `updateProfile` mutation has a **limited scope** compared to registration fields:

| Field | Registration | Profile Edit | Reason |
|-------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Mobile Number | ✅ Required | ❌ Not editable | Security consideration |
| Email | ✅ Required | ❌ Not editable | Security/verification |
| Birthdate | ✅ Required | ❌ Not editable | Core identity data |
| Gender | ✅ Required | ❌ Not editable | Core identity data |
| Sexual Orientation | ✅ Required | ❌ Not editable | Missing from API |
| Location (City/State/Country) | ✅ Optional | ❌ Not editable | Missing from API |

**Impact:** Users can only edit **5 out of 11** registration fields after signup.

**Recommendation:** This limitation appears intentional for data integrity, but consider adding separate admin-only mutations for sensitive field updates if business requirements demand it.

### 2. Messaging System
**Status: ⚠️ 95% Complete - Minor Display Issue**

**✅ Fully Supported:**
- ✅ Inbox page with Primary Photo
- ✅ Last message excerpt display
- ✅ Complete conversation page functionality
- ✅ Message composer with send functionality

**❌ Minor Issue:**
The `conversations` query only returns `firstName` for users, but the deliverable specifies "First Name **and Last Name**" in inbox contacts.

**Current API:**
```graphql
query Conversations {
  conversations {
    userA { firstName } # ❌ Missing lastName
    userB { firstName } # ❌ Missing lastName
  }
}
```

**Required Fix:**
```graphql
query Conversations {
  conversations {
    userA { firstName, lastName } # ✅ Add lastName
    userB { firstName, lastName } # ✅ Add lastName  
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Minimal - affects only the display format in inbox list. Core messaging functionality is complete.
